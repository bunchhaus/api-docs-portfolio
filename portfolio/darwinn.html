        <p class="intro-text">At Google, I was responsible for creating developer-facing documentation for an internal SDK that enabled machine learning researchers and engineers to run TensorFlow models efficiently on specialized hardware. The SDK, known internally as DarwiNN, provided a complete toolchain for model training, conversion, profiling, and deployment.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>My role was to make this complex, hardware-integrated workflow clear, navigable, and productive for diverse developer audiences.</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

        <ul class="simple-list">
            <li><strong>Complex Toolchain</strong> – The SDK spanned compilers, profilers, simulators, runtimes, and numerics validation.</li>
            <li><strong>Diverse Users</strong> – From novice TensorFlow users who wanted "drop-in" simplicity, to advanced engineers seeking low-level TPU programmability.</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation Gaps</strong> – Critical workflows were scattered across systems, and engineers struggled to understand why models failed to compile or how to optimize for TPU hardware.</li>
            <li><strong>Internal Infrastructure</strong> – Work required navigating Google's internal systems (bug trackers, changelists, internal search engines, go links) to locate SMEs and surface authoritative information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Approach</h2>

        <h3>1. User Journeys</h3>
        <p>I mapped out the <strong>end-to-end developer workflow</strong> into four critical stages:</p>
        <ul class="simple-list">
            <li><strong>Build a Model</strong> – Author in TensorFlow, train, evaluate quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Port a Model</strong> – Convert to TFLite, compile/lower to target hardware.</li>
            <li><strong>Profile a Model</strong> – Validate accuracy, measure performance KPIs.</li>
            <li><strong>Deploy a Model</strong> – Integrate with runtime, optimize, and run at scale.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This framework became the backbone of the SDK documentation.</p>

        <h3>2. Audience Segmentation</h3>
        <p>I identified three primary user types and aligned documentation strategy to their needs:</p>
        <ul class="simple-list">
            <li><strong>Novice Developers</strong> – wanted "out-of-the-box" functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Motivated Developers</strong> – willing to adapt models and use SDK tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Developers</strong> – required low-level TPU programmability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Toolchain Documentation</h3>
        <p>For each tool (Compiler, Profiler, Simulator, Runtime, Numerics), I created:</p>
        <ul class="simple-list">
            <li><strong>Conceptual overviews</strong> – what the tool is and when to use it.</li>
            <li><strong>User guides</strong> – step-by-step workflows.</li>
            <li><strong>Best practices</strong> – performance tuning and optimization tips.</li>
            <li><strong>Sample code and troubleshooting</strong> – concrete examples with error handling.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Cross-Team Collaboration</h3>
        <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>Partnered with SMEs across engineering to validate technical accuracy.</li>
            <li>Used bug tracking systems and changelists to manage documentation requests.</li>
            <li>Implemented process improvements for doc accountability and timely reviews.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Deliverables</h2>

        <ul class="simple-list">
            <li><strong>Comprehensive SDK User Guide</strong> covering build → port → profile → deploy.</li>
            <li><strong>Best Practices and Troubleshooting Guides</strong> for compilers, profilers, and runtime integration.</li>
            <li><strong>Sample Code Snippets</strong> for TensorFlow/Keras workflows.</li>
            <li><strong>Audience-specific guidance</strong> (novice vs advanced usage paths).</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation process improvements</strong> to streamline review and approval cycles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Impact</h2>

        <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>Created a <strong>single, authoritative source of truth</strong> for DarwiNN SDK users.</li>
            <li>Significantly reduced developer confusion around model compilation and TPU deployment.</li>
            <li>Enabled ML researchers and engineers to move from prototype to deployment faster by clarifying workflows and exposing best practices.</li>
            <li>Demonstrated ability to <strong>translate highly complex, proprietary systems into accessible, developer-friendly documentation</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>

        <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>API & SDK documentation</li>
            <li>Developer workflows (TensorFlow, model training & inference)</li>
            <li>Information architecture & user journeys</li>
            <li>Working with SMEs & cross-functional engineering teams</li>
            <li>Managing documentation processes with bug trackers and changelists</li>
