# Restructuring the MATI-SRT Documentation (Google, Internal)

## Overview

At Google, I worked on **MATI-SRT**, an internal security and reliability initiative that supported both engineers and external integrations. My role was to restructure and streamline the documentation site (G3Docs) to make it usable for multiple audiences.

The project involved cleaning up scattered, outdated content and building a clear information architecture that mapped technical domains, integrations, and platforms into a discoverable hierarchy.

## The Challenge

- **Unstructured Content** – Documentation was a long, unordered list of pages with no clear hierarchy or navigation..
- **Mixed Audiences** – Pages served both internal engineers (on-call, platform teams) and external customers/integrators, but content was not tailored to either group.
- **Broken Links and Outdated Material** – Legacy docs contained inconsistencies and dead ends, making it difficult to rely on.
- **Scalability** – Documentation needed to evolve with integrations and platforms while remaining maintainable.

## Approach

### 1. Information Architecture (IA)

1. Audited existing content and identified **purpose + audience** for each page.

2. Created a structured hierarchy in G3Docs:

   - **MATI Domains** (core security and reliability features).
   - **Off-Google Integrations** (e.g., Crowdstrike, DNS Sinkhole, Qualys, SSH Gateway, Web Proxy).
   - **Platforms** (Rampart, Inconel, Patchtoday, Data Migration).

### 2. Landing Page Design

1. Built a **clear entry point** for MATI-SRT documentation.

2. Sections included:

   - **Getting Started** provided overview, access.
   - **Audience/Purpose** provided clarification.
   - **Focus Areas** broken into Domains, Integrations, Platforms.

### 3. Cleanup & Migration

1. Reviewed and updated outdated material.

2. Fixed broken links and created a migration plan for redundant or obsolete content.

3. Organized included files into consistent folders for maintainability.

### 4. Cross-Team Collaboration

- Partnered with POCs and platform teams (Rampart, Mesa).
  
- Coordinated with on-call engineers to capture accurate workflows.
  
- Delivered wireframes for the “Integrations” section to align stakeholders on structure.

## Deliverables

- Restructured MATI-SRT G3Docs site with clear IA.
  
- Landing Page providing context, access guidance, and navigation by focus area.
  
- Wireframes for integrations documentation.

- Updated and migrated content, eliminating broken links and redundancy.

## Impact

- Created a **coherent documentation site** where previously there was only a scattered page list.
  
- Clarified **audience-based content** (internal engineers vs external customers).
  
- Improved developer productivity by reducing time wasted searching unstructured docs.
  
- Established a **repeatable template** for structuring complex G3Docs sites, later referenced in similar efforts.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Information architecture (IA) and content strategy.
  
- Internal developer documentation (G3Docs).
  
- Security & reliability documentation for integrations and platforms.
  
- Collaboration with cross-functional teams (engineers, PMs, and POCs).

- Migration and link validation at scale.
