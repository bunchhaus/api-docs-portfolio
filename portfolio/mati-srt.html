        <p class="intro-text">At Google, I worked on MATI-SRT, an internal security and reliability initiative that supported both engineers and external integrations. My role was to restructure and streamline the documentation site (G3Docs) to make it usable for multiple audiences.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>The project involved cleaning up scattered, outdated content and building a clear information architecture that mapped technical domains, integrations, and platforms into a discoverable hierarchy.</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

        <ul class="simple-list">
            <li><strong>Unstructured Content</strong> – Documentation was a long, unordered list of pages with no clear hierarchy or navigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Mixed Audiences</strong> – Pages served both internal engineers (on-call, platform teams) and external customers/integrators, but content was not tailored to either group.</li>
            <li><strong>Broken Links and Outdated Material</strong> – Legacy docs contained inconsistencies and dead ends, making it difficult to rely on.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability</strong> – Documentation needed to evolve with integrations and platforms while remaining maintainable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Approach</h2>

        <h3>1. Information Architecture</h3>
        <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>Audited existing content and identified <strong>purpose + audience</strong> for each page.</li>
            <li>Created a <strong>structured hierarchy</strong> in G3Docs:
                <ul class="simple-list" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
                    <li><strong>MATI Domains</strong> (core security and reliability features).</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Google Integrations</strong> (e.g., Crowdstrike, DNS Sinkhole, Qualys, SSH Gateway, Web Proxy).</li>
                    <li><strong>Platforms</strong> (Rampart, Inconel, Patchtoday, Data Migration).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Landing Page Design</h3>
        <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>Built a <strong>clear entry point</strong> for MATI-SRT documentation.</li>
            <li>Sections included:
                <ul class="simple-list" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
                    <li><strong>Getting Started</strong> (overview, access).</li>
                    <li><strong>Audience/Purpose</strong> clarification.</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus Areas</strong> broken into Domains, Integrations, Platforms.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Cleanup & Migration</h3>
        <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>Reviewed and updated outdated material.</li>
            <li>Fixed broken links and created a migration plan for redundant or obsolete content.</li>
            <li>Organized include files into consistent folders for maintainability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Collaboration</h3>
        <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>Partnered with POCs (Rick Brooks, Srini) and platform teams (Rampart, Mesa).</li>
            <li>Coordinated with on-call engineers to capture accurate workflows.</li>
            <li>Delivered wireframes for the "Integrations" section to align stakeholders on structure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Deliverables</h2>

        <ul class="simple-list">
            <li><strong>Restructured MATI-SRT G3Docs site</strong> with clear IA.</li>
            <li><strong>Landing Page</strong> providing context, access guidance, and navigation by focus area.</li>
            <li><strong>Wireframes</strong> for integrations documentation.</li>
            <li><strong>Updated and migrated content</strong>, eliminating broken links and redundancy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Impact</h2>

        <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>Created a <strong>coherent documentation site</strong> where previously there was only a scattered page list.</li>
            <li>Clarified <strong>audience-based content</strong> (internal engineers vs external customers).</li>
            <li>Improved developer productivity by reducing time wasted searching unstructured docs.</li>
            <li>Established a <strong>repeatable template</strong> for structuring complex G3Docs sites, later referenced in similar efforts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>

        <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>Information architecture (IA) and content strategy.</li>
            <li>Internal developer documentation (G3Docs).</li>
            <li>Security & reliability documentation for integrations and platforms.</li>
            <li>Collaboration with engineers, PMs, and POCs.</li>
            <li>Migration and link validation at scale.</li>
        </ul>
