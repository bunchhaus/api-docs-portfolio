# Weather & Surf Report API Documentation

This repository contains a single API documentation project built as part of my API documentation practice. The documentation covers both the **Weather API** (based on OpenWeatherMap) and a sample **Surf Report API**.

## Reference Endpoints

### Weather API

- [Get Current Weather](reference/endpoints.md#get-current-weather-by-zip-code)  
- [Get 5-Day Forecast](reference/forecast.md#get-5-day-forecast-by-zip-code)

### Surf Report API

- [Get Surf Conditions by Beach ID](reference/surf.md#get-surf-conditions-by-beach-id)

## Navigation Tips

- All endpoints are available through the live Redoc site.  
- Each endpoint includes request structure, query parameters, and example JSON responses.  
- Tables break down key response fields for developers.

## Skills & Tools

- OpenAPI 3.0 (YAML)  
- Redoc for API rendering  
- Markdown documentation structure  
- HTML/CSS integration  
- GitHub Pages deployment
