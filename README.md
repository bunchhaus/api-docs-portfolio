# Weather & Surf Report API Documentation

This repository contains two complete API documentation projects built as part of my API documentation practice:

- **[Weather API Documentation](./index.html)** – Documentation for the OpenWeatherMap API, including current weather and 5-day forecast endpoints.
- **[Surf Report API Documentation](./surf.html)** – Documentation for a sample Surf Report API, including authentication, forecast, and schema references.

## Reference Endpoints (Weather API)

- [Get Current Weather](reference/endpoints.md#get-current-weather-by-zip-code)  
- [Get 5-Day Forecast](reference/forecast.md#get-5-day-forecast-by-zip-code)

## Navigation Tips
