# Weather API Documentation

This repository contains a single API documentation project built as part of my API documentation portfolio.  
The focus is on the **Weather API** (based on OpenWeatherMap).  
Other experimental APIs (such as a Surf Report API) are included in the repo for practice but are not part of the published docs.

## Project Scope

This project was created to demonstrate skills in:

- Designing and structuring API documentation in Markdown  
- Authoring an OpenAPI 3.0 specification (YAML)  
- Rendering docs with Redoc  
- Integrating with HTML/CSS and deploying via GitHub Pages  

The end result is a professional, portfolio-ready API doc site suitable for developer onboarding.

## Reference Endpoints

### Weather API

- [Get Current Weather](reference/endpoints.md#get-current-weather-by-zip-code)  
- [Get 5-Day Forecast](reference/forecast.md#get-5-day-forecast-by-zip-code)

## Navigation Tips

- All endpoints are available through the live Redoc site.  
- Each endpoint includes request structure, query parameters, and example JSON responses.  
- Tables break down key response fields for developers.
