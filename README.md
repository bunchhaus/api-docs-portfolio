## Portfolio Overview

This portfolio combines case studies from actual Google projects with a comprehensive API documentation sample to demonstrate the full spectrum of technical writing skills required for senior documentation roles.

### Google Case Studies (Real Work)

Professional documentation projects completed at Google, showcasing measurable impact on developer productivity and large-scale information architecture work. Due to confidentiality requirements, these case studies focus on process, methodology, and results rather than proprietary content.

- **[DarwiNN SDK Documentation](portfolio/darwinn.html)** - Complete developer documentation for internal machine learning SDK, including user journeys, toolchain guides, and audience-specific workflows for TensorFlow to TPU deployment.

- **[MATI-SRT Documentation Restructure](portfolio/matl-srt.html)** - Large-scale information architecture project for internal security platform documentation, transforming scattered content into a structured, audience-focused site.

### Sample API Documentation Project

A comprehensive API documentation project created to demonstrate technical writing skills and documentation architecture expertise. This Weather API documentation showcases professional-grade work equivalent to enterprise developer documentation.
