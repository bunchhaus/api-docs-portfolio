# API Best Practices

This guide provides best practices for working with the Weather API.  
Following these recommendations will help ensure efficient, reliable, and secure integration.

## Authentication

- Always pass your **API key** (`appid`) as a query parameter.  
- Never embed your API key in public code repositories. Use environment variables or configuration files.

## Request Efficiency

- **Be specific in queries**:  
  Use coordinates (`lat`, `lon`) when possible instead of general city names. Coordinates return faster and avoid ambiguity (e.g., multiple "Springfield" cities).

- **Limit request frequency**:  
  Avoid sending unnecessary duplicate requests. Cache results where appropriate—weather data typically updates every few minutes, not seconds.

## Error Handling

- Handle standard HTTP response codes:  
  - `200`: Successful request  
  - `401`: Invalid or missing API key  
  - `404`: City not found  
  - `429`: Too many requests (rate limited)  

- Always build retry logic with exponential backoff for temporary errors.

## Rate Limits

- The free tier of the API enforces **rate limiting**.  
- Avoid hitting rate limits by:
  - Caching responses locally.  
  - Scheduling updates at reasonable intervals (e.g., every 10 minutes).  
  - Consolidating requests where possible.  

## Localization

- Use the `lang` parameter to return weather descriptions in your user’s preferred language.  
- If you don’t specify `lang`, the API defaults to English.

## Units and Data Consistency

- Always set the `units` parameter (`metric`, `imperial`, or `standard`) to ensure consistent data across your application.  
- Document internally which unit system your app expects—mixing units can cause errors.

## Security

- Use HTTPS (`https://`) for all requests to encrypt traffic.  
- Rotate your API key periodically for security.  
- Do not expose keys in client-side code when building public-facing apps.

## Testing

- Use sample locations (e.g., `q=London`) for initial testing.  
- Validate edge cases such as:  
  - Invalid city names  
  - Extreme weather values (very high/low temps, high wind speeds)  
  - Empty or missing parameters  

By following these best practices, developers can integrate the Weather API in a way that is **efficient, secure, and user-friendly**.
